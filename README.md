# GBM Plus API Python Library

The GBM Plus API Python library aims to provide all current API calls to interface with the GBM Plus/Homebroker platform.

## Setup

1. Get the CLIENT_ID from the GBM Plus login dashboard
![(Where to find client_id screenshot) Navigate to Github repository to view image](.github/images/client_id.png)

2. Keep your USER_EMAIL, USER_PASSWORD and CLIENT_ID safe and secure. You can use environment variables for development.

3. Install the latest version of [Python 3](ttps://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)

4. Use _pip_ (or an alternative such as _easy_install_) to install the library from the Python [Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/gbmplus/):
    * `pip install gbmplus`
    * If you have both Python3 and Python2 installed, you may need to use `pip3` (so `pip3 install gbmplus`) along with `python3` on your system
    * If gbmplus was previously installed, you can upgrade to the latest non-beta release with `pip install --upgrade gbmplus`

## Usage

1. Export your USER_EMAIL, USER_PASSWORD and CLIENT_ID as [environment variables](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html), for example:

    Linux

    ```shell
    export USER_EMAIL=xxxxxx@xxxxx.com
    export USER_PASSWORD=shabadabadashabadabadaenelcentrodelplaneta
    export CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```

    Windows Powershell

    ```powershell
    $env:USER_EMAIL="xxxxxx@xxxxx.com"
    $env:USER_PASSWORD="shabadabadashabadabadaolvidadoenlabanqueta"
    $env:CLIENT_ID="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    ```

2. Alternatively, define your USER_EMAIL, USER_PASSWORD and CLIENT_ID as variables in your source code; this method is not recommended due to its inherent insecurity.

3. Single line of code to import and use the library goes at the top of your script:

    ```python
    import gbmplus
    ```

4. Instantiate the client (API consumer class), optionally specifying any of the parameters available to set:

    ```python
    trader_object = gbmplus.GBMPlusAPI(output_log=False)
    ```

5. Make API calls in your source code, using the format _client.scope.operation_, where _client_ is the name you defined in the previous step (**trader_object** above), _scope_ is the corresponding scope that represents a module, and _operation_ is the operation of the API endpoint. For example, to make a call to get the list of Accounts (or Strategies), use this function call:

    ```python
    accounts = trader_object.accounts.getAccounts()
    print(accounts)
    ```
